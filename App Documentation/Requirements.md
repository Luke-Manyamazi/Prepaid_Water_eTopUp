# Prepaid Water Top-up App â€“ Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement

Many prepaid electricity and water users face challenges when topping up their meters due to reliance on keypads.  
Currently, users must purchase a token from retail outlets or online, then manually enter it on a keypad near the meter.  
This process has several limitations, including:

- Risk of losing paper tokens  
- Inconvenience of sending tokens to someone on-site  
- Unavailability of tokens at retailers  
- Inability to top up when stores are closed  
- Faulty keypads preventing successful recharges  

To address these issues, we propose developing a web app that enables **direct meter top-ups**, eliminating the need for keypads.  
This app will allow users to:

- Purchase tokens seamlessly from vendors  
- Top up from anywhere  
- Check balances  
- Review purchase history and usage reports  
- Manage multiple meters

## 2. Project Goals

- Eliminate manual keypad-based top-ups  
- Increase user convenience and access  
- Provide a secure, user-friendly interface  
- Enable real-time top-up confirmation  
- Support multiple meter management  

---

## 3. Core Features (MVP)

- âœ… User authentication (Sign up, login)  
- âœ… Meter registration and validation  
- âœ… Purchase top-up via online payment  
- âœ… View balance and purchase history  
- âœ… Support for topping up own or others' meters  
- âœ… Secure transaction system  
- âœ… Admin dashboard for monitoring  

---

## 4. Additional Features (Post-MVP)

- In-app notifications or SMS alerts  
- Meter balance reminders  
- Monthly usage reports  
- Integration with electricity top-up (multi-utility app)  
- Multi-language support  
- Offline capabilities or SMS fallback

## 5. User Stories

* As a **user**, I want to **sign up and log in**, so that I can securely access my account.
* As a **user**, I want to **top up my water meter**, so that I can get water credit without entering a token.
* As a **user**, I want to **register a new meter**, so that I can manage multiple meters from one account.
* As a **user**, I want to **see my balance**, so that I know how much water credit I have left.
* As a **user**, I want to **see a purchase history/report**, so that I can track my water usage and spending.
* As a **user**, I want to **top up someone elseâ€™s meter**, so that I can help friends or family.
* As a **user**, I want to **delete a meter**, so that I can remove old or invalid meters from my account.
* As a **vendor**, I want to **validate new meter numbers**, so that only active and supported meters can be used.
* As an **admin**, I want to **monitor all top-ups and transactions**, so that I can ensure the system is running smoothly.
