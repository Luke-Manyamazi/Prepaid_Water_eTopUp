Problem Statement
Prepaid electricity and water users often experience difficulties when topping up their meters due to reliance on physical keypads. 
The current process—buying tokens from retailers or online, then manually inputting them into a keypad—is inconvenient and error-prone. 
Users risk losing paper tokens, face challenges when sending tokens remotely, encounter unavailability at retail points, and are unable to top up when stores are closed. 
Faulty or inaccessible keypads further hinder successful recharges.

To solve these issues, this project proposes an application that enables direct top-ups to prepaid meters, eliminating the need for keypad entry. 
The app will allow users to purchase tokens anytime, anywhere; view balances; access purchase history and usage reports; and manage multiple meters from a 
single platform—greatly enhancing convenience, reliability, and accessibility.
